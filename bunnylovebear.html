  <h1>The Gift!</h1>
  <div class="textbox"> 
    <p><br><br>
      You've arrived, i've been waiting for you. This is it, this is the end of the road, the moment you've been waiting for, 
      THE Gift, and you'll be wondering, What is it? Well, maybe, the gift is the friends we made along the way- 
      <span class="emphasis"> GET OU- </span>
    </p> 
    
    <p>
      Now seriously, the gift isn't anything crazy, i thought i could write a letter, a very glorified letter, since i made a whole treasure hunt and website
      just for you to end up reading this, but i hope you do enjoy this, cause i thought it would be a cool Saint Valentine's Gift if i showed my love and appreciation
      for you with a little love letter, like you did, though i didn't have time to finish it, as you know, this is a mixed gift, both parts Saint Valentine's and birthday.
      I didn't have any ideas for your birthday gift, but the Saint Valentine's one was going to be a love letter in the form of a little website, i decided to change it up a little bit
      by making a funny treasure hunt, to make it more unique, hope you had fun with that, i worked pretty hard to code the Trivia and the Snookie Y^Y.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, how do i start this letter, you know i'm pretty bad at expressing myself, i can yap a lot but i struggle to really put out my feelings, i'll try anyway just
      for you. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I'd like to start by saying that life has been a little tough for me these last few years, i've had to deal with things and feelings that i had never experienced before,
      like anxiety, depression, and loneliness. I've never had many friends, and the few i had were lost when i moved to go to Uni, you know the story, the point is that since you are in my life,
      as a partner, things have started to look better for me, now i don't feel alone, i don't feel sad, like nobody will ever bare my presence for more than a couple months, because we have
      grown to be very close, and you've turned into the person i always wanted, a person i could trust, a person i could talk to, a person i could enjoy my time with, and mainly, a person that puts
      the effort back into the relationship, just someone that you know that cares about you. I'm not one to trust very fast, or so i'd like to say, because i usually end up trusting too much, too fast, too easily, 
      but i'm glad that the trust i've put in you hasn't turned into a mistake, and instead, into something infinitely valuable i don't see myself without.
    </p>

    <p>
      The time i've spent with you these last 10 months with you has been amazing, i love talking to you, playing with you, joking with you, every little moment i really enjoy, i'm very glad you are around
      and you've become something essential in my day to day, something to look forward too. Being around you is always fun, even if you sometimes don't see anything good in yourself, i wish you'd see yourself
      in my eyes, because to me you are amazing, to me you are something rare, something unique, something i at one point stopped believing could exist. I really appreciate you being in my life, you taking the time to be
      with me, you taking the effort to show that you care, to pay attention to my shenanigans, like reading this long ass letter, you are just anything i could've ever wanted. I've been in numerous relationships, just like you
      but in none of them i've felt how i feel with you, not the amount of trust we have, nor that feeling that fills my chest everytime i am with you, i think i can safely say by now, that i haven't loved anyone as much as i
      love you. You truly are the best thing in my life right now, and there's nothing i look forward to more than seeing you in real life, giving you a hug and a big sloppy kiss on those lips >:3.
    </p>

    <p> 
      To sum it all up, you are just a short, lovable 19 years old American boy/bear who really cares about his silly little 19 year old Spanish bunny boy.
      <br><br>
      And this bunny seriously loves you a lot, and can't bear stand a single day without you, you mean so much to me, and i wanna spend the rest day with you, and i know you feel the same way.
      <br><br>
      I know this letter was long, but i wanted to express my feelings properly.
      <br><br>
      I love you, Jacob Paul James. Happy 19th birthday, happy late Saint Valentine's day, never change, and continue to be the person i love.
      <br><br>
      Sincerely, your bunny Noah.
